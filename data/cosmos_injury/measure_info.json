Data is accessed via SlicerDicer, a self-service analytics tool. The dataset includes emergency department visits, diagnoses, immunizations, laboratory results, and other clinical data. Due to privacy protections, counts fewer than 10 are suppressed and imputed. Coverage extends across all U.S. states and territories. Note that county-level and city-level stratifications could differ markedly in total sample size due to high levels of missingness of county data in some states.",
